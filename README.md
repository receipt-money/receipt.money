A DeFi platform revolutionizing liquidity through Crypto Receipts, integrating AI agents for optimized asset management.

## Description:

Receipt Money addresses the liquidity challenges in decentralized finance by introducing Crypto Receipts (CRs). Inspired by traditional bank receipts, CRs tokenize staked or locked assets, allowing users to unlock liquidity without forfeiting rewards. Built on the Solana blockchain, Receipt Money ensures high-speed, low-cost transactions, enhancing capital efficiency for DeFi participants. Future versions aim to integrate AI agents (Def
Ai) to automate yield optimization and asset management strategies.


## Features:

- Crypto Receipts (CRs): Tokenize staked assets to unlock liquidity.
- AI Integration (DefAi): Automate yield optimization and asset management.
- Multi-Asset Support: Handle various assets, including tokenized assets. 
- Cross-Chain Compatibility: Utilize Solana's Wormhole for interoperability.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simplify DeFi interactions for all user levels.
